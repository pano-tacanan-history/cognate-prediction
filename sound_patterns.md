# Sound patterns

## Core set

- Correct the failed prediction of /ɽ/ to /n/ for more words (01_n-to-r)
- Loss of initial /hi/ (esp. on three-syllabic words?) (02_initial-hi-drop)
- Loss of initial /ɨ/ (esp. on transitive verbs?) (03_initial-ɨ-drop)
- Drop of intervocalic fricatives in certain contexts (ergative? plural?) (0ɾ_intervocalic-fric)
- Drop or gain of initial /β/ (05_initial-b)
- Correspondence of Proto-Tacanan /j/ and /ʃ/ to fricatives in Panoan (06_se-to-sche)
- Correspondence of Proto-Tacanan /e/ to Proto-Panoan /ɨ/ (07_mid-to-front)
- Correspondence of Proto-Tacanan /z/ to /ʃ/ or /s/ (08_sche-to-se)
- Correspondences of retroflexes /ɽ/ to /ʂ/ (09_retroflexes)

### 1: drop of initial ɨ/i

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
51 | core | drink | [i/ɨ]s[i/ɨ] | ʂɨ-ati  | case 1 |
14 | extended | call | [i/ɨ]ɽana | ɽana-ti | case 2|
131 | core | porcupine | [i/ɨ]sa | isá | Initial /i/ not dropped |
132 | extended | lightning | [i/ɨ]βaβ[i/ɨ] | iβi | irregular, but also initial /i/ |

--> 131 shows that initial /i/ is not dropped - but there are no words with initial /ɨ/ that are cognate

Only verbs - possibly a prefix?
Do the forms really reconstruct to Proto-Panoan?

### 2: Correspondence P-t /e/ to P-P /i/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
132 | core | pull | n[i/ɨ]nɨ | nini-ti | Case 1 |
66 | extended | maize | s[i/ɨ]kɨ | ʂɨki | Case 2 |

Both problematic vowels may not reconstruct to Proto-Pano!
For maize, Northern has /ʂikʂu/
For drag, Northern has /nin/, Kakataibo has niri

### 3: /s/ to /ʃ/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
2 | core | announce | [k/w]ɨ[i/ɨ]sa | kɨʃa-n-ti | Case 1 |
105 | core | long | sono | ʃono | Case 2; long > lupuna, seems reasonable |
179 | extended | sand | mɨs[i/ɨ] | maʃi | Case 3; vowel needs to be explained as well |

179 is probably not cognate!
Proto-Tacana has diphtong, unclear how this should be realized! But probably alternatives with /e/

Reconstruction 105 in Proto-Tacanan has problems, might be the same /s/ as for the first case

### 4: Drop of intervocalic friccative

ID | Set | concept | Proto-Tacana | Predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
15 | core | bitter | patʂe | paʂɨ | paɨ | Case 1 |
3 | extended | arrow | pisa | p[i/ɨ]sa | pia | Case 2 |
180 | core | toucan | pitsa | p[i/ɨ]ʂa | pisa | Does not drop! But exactly same context as 3 |
2 | extended | achiote | matʂe | maʂɨ | maʂɨ | Does not drop, but exact same context as 15! |
62 | core | fish poison | aʈʂa | [a/hi]ʂa | aʂa | does not drop, stress on first syllable |
131 | core | porcupine | iʃa | [i/ɨ]sa | isá | does also not drop |

/p/ as defining context? Seems weird to me, but maybe worth testing

180: comes from /e/, pesa
Maybe this vowel behaves different form the vowels /a/ and /i/?

At least arrow and achoite DO reconstruct to Proto-Panoan

### 5: /ɽ/ to /ʂ/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
16 | core | blow (of person) | ɽo | ʂo-na-ti | Case 1 |
7 | extended | bathe | naɽ[i/ɨ] | naʂi-ti | Case 2 |

Northern has /s/, Amawaka /ʃ/, others /ʂ/ - Oliveira reconstructs /s/

### 6: Loss of initial [a/hi]

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
27 | core | carry | [a/hi]βo | βo-na-ti | Case 1 |
108 | core | molar tooth | [a/hi]maka | maka | Case 2 |
71 | core | friend | [a/hi][t/ts/tʃ]a | tʃan | Case 3 |
62 | core | fish hook | [a/hi]ʂa | aʂa | Does not drop |

Loss of initial syllable to get two-syllabic words?
Considering 62: Maybe loss of initial /hi/ when three sylalbles?
Reconstruction of /himi/ and /hiwi/ for Proto-Pano

### 7: /ʂ/ to /ɽ/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
80 | core | grain | ʂo | βɨ-ɽo | Case 1 |

Very few evidence, probably not worth trying
Aji: b i ʃ u in Proto-Takana

### 8: /s/ to /ʂ/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
66 | extended | maize | s[i/ɨ]kɨ | ʂɨki | Case 1 |
233 | extended | hot | s[i/ɨ]na | ʂana | Case 2 |
51 | core | drink | [i/ɨ]s[i/ɨ] | ʂɨ-ati  | case 3 |

Second case has vowel problems!

### 9: Loss of initial /β/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
53 | extended | heavy | β[i/ɨ][k/w]ɨ | iwɨ | Case 1 |
55 | extended | louse | β[i/ɨ]a | ia | Case 2 |
105 | extended | wasp | β[i/ɨ]na | βina | Does not drop! |
108 | extended | bullet ant | βona | βona | Does also not drop |
76 | extended | stay |[a/hi]n[i/ɨ] |  βanɨ-ti | funny, here comes one out of zero |

Only drops if followed by (semi-) vowel?

Glottal stops in many languages! Reconstructs nicely, and word where it does not drop are not reconstructable it seems

### 11: /a/ to /i/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
164 | extended | agouti | mara | maɽi | Case 1 |

### 12: [i/ɨ] to /a/

ID | Set | concept | predicted | form | comment |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
179 | extended | sand | mɨs[i/ɨ] | maʃi | Case 1 |
233 | extended | hot | s[i/ɨ]na | ʂana | Case 2 |
307 | extended | sweet | β[i/ɨ][t/ts/tʃ]a | βata | Case 3 |

Both cases have friccative problems that can be solved

Check friccative correspondence patterns in detail!

third vowel pattern? Proto-Takana /i/ to Proto-Pano /a/
But first case: /e/ in Proto-Takana, might not be cognate actually!
